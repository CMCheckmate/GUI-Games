CONCEPTUAL STATEMENT
Your aim is to create a survival clicker/shooter game.
The program is to operate on equipment provided by the school using the Windows environment.
SPECIFICATIONS
The game must have instructions on how to play.
The user must be able to:
- Use the direction keys (w, a, s, d) to control the movement of the character on screen
- Use the mouse to click and shoot projectiles
- Restart the game once the game is over
The character must not be able to disappear off the screen (e.g. the top, bottom, left or right of the screen).
The character must have smooth movement with no delay upon direction input.
Both the player and enemies should have a health system.
Enemy health must reduce when hit by a player projectile.
Enemies must spawn in waves with each wave increasing in difficulty (e.g. number of enemies).
Enemies must die and be removed when health dropped to 0.
The player's health must decrease when damaged by enemy.
Game must end when the player's health drops to 0.
Enemy waves must continue to spawn until the player dies.
The scoring system should be based off the amount of waves of enemies the player survives.

The game should not lag or reduce performance based on the length of gameplay or once the game is
restarted.
The game must work as described but does not need to be ‘pretty’.
